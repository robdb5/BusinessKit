# BusinessKit
MassMutual Application
In October of 2012, I completed a project building an interactive DVD ‘Business Kit’ for Veritech, a media company in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. The end client was MassMutual. During the past several years there have been five updates to the original project adding new content and functionality. The most recent of these was in 2017.
· Visio flowchart
· Design UI for ‘Business Markets’ DVD project
· Create ‘Business Kit’ panel based on Excel documentation
· Develop modular shell that loads, via XML, multiple SWFs
· Incorporate PDFs, PPTs, calculators, and videos
· Integrate graphic designer’s images and assets
· Create desktop installer
